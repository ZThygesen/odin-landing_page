This project was built to practice basic CSS and HTML; specifically flexboxes.

It started as an attempt to copy a basic "Landing Page" format provided by The Odin Project. Once I successfully replicated the page, I customized it and added my own personal touches. I connected the previous "Recipes" project I did for The Odin Project to the landing page and added my own CSS to them.
